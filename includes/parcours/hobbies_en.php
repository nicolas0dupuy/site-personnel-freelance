        <strong>Philosophy:</strong> A balance between discipline, pleasure, and mutual support.
    </p>

    <p>
        Beyond my professional and academic life, my passions bring me balance. I have always enjoyed committing to what motivates me, not for the sake of performance, but for the pleasure, for sharing and contributing.

            <h4>Martial Arts</h4>
            <p>
                <strong>18 years of Vovinam Viet Vo Dao practice</strong>, including 6 years as club President. I had the pleasure of getting involved to help my fellow members, share my passion, and manage our association's life.
            </p>

            <h4>Other Sports</h4>
            <p>
                Sports remain essential to me. I am an eternal beginner in artistic gymnastics, and I occasionally enjoy swimming or rock climbing. My sole motivation is the pleasure and well-being, with no search for performance.
            </p>

            <h4>Volunteering</h4>
            <p>
                I am committed to regularly donating blood and, more frequently, platelets. I have surpassed fifty platelet donations since I started in university, and I am happy to help medical teams with the little I can do.
