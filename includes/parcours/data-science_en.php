    <h2>From Fundamental Research to Data Science</h2>

        <strong>Period:</strong> 2016 - Present (Continuous Learning)
    </p>

    <p>
        After my PhD, my curiosity led me to data science, a field that was already popular in the United States but still relatively emerging in France. I quickly grew fond of this field, a gateway to many others (medical, financial, socioeconomic...). Today, I explore both the theoretical foundations of algorithms and their concrete applications with the same curiosity, while also having the pleasure of transmitting this passion as a trainer in higher education.

            <h4>Continuous Learning Platforms</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Datacamp (since 2018):</strong> Constant learning and practice on the entire data ecosystem (Python, SQL, Machine Learning, Data Engineering...).</li>
                <li><strong>Coursera:</strong> Beyond Andrew Ng's foundational certifications ("Machine Learning Specialization" & "Deep Learning Specialization"), I use the platform for active monitoring and continuous learning across a broad spectrum of IT topics.</li>
                <li><strong>Google Cloud Platform (GCP):</strong> Deepening my expertise in the GCP ecosystem to take data projects from experimentation to production. This includes data architecture (BigQuery), model deployment (Vertex AI), and business intelligence (Looker Studio).</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Advanced & Research-Level Training (AI)</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Stanford University (online):</strong> Followed the course <a href="http://cs236.stanford.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CS236 - Deep Generative Models</a>. Achieved very good results on exams and practical workshops, and while I couldn't submit the final project due to lack of time, I independently advanced my VAE model project on brain MRIs with TensorFlow to an advanced stage.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Sorbonne University (from Sep. 2025):</strong> As part of my continuing education, taking Master's level Teaching Units specializing in Computer Vision, with a focus on the opportunity to collaborate with brilliant students.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Active Watch:</strong> Regularly following courses and seminars from Stanford and other leading institutions through their publications and YouTube channels.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h4>IT Journey Anecdotes</h4>
            <div class="anecdote-item" style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom: 25px;">
                <p>“My first encounter with a computer, in the mid-80s, was a Commodore PET inherited from my uncle. A machine with a cassette tape drive for storage and a screen that only displayed characters, but it had immense sentimental value. A few years later, when I was 9 or 10, I learned to program in Omikron Basic on an Atari 520 STE whose memory had been expanded to... a whole megabyte!”</p>

            <div class="anecdote-item" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 25px;">
                <p>“The first program I was proud of on the Atari was a small game: a yellow circle, moved with a joystick, that would leave a trail if you held down the button... but for no more than 20 seconds, or it would turn red and the game was over! That was the era of BASIC, with its numbered lines and GOTO statements. Since then, I know I must make great efforts for the readability of my programs!”</p>
