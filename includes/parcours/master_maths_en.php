    <h2>Mathematics Curriculum (Bachelor's & Master's)</h2>

        <strong>Period:</strong> 2002 - 2005 (and subsequent isolated courses)
    </p>

    <p>
        I studied fundamental mathematics, obtaining a Bachelor's degree with honors ("Mention Bien", 0.25 points shy of highest honors) and a Master's degree ("Mention Assez Bien"), as well as credits from the second year of the Master's program. This path forged my reasoning and abstraction abilities, and the art of the proof.

                    <p>“At 18, I was convinced I was bad at mathematics. No one, not even me, would have bet that I would come this far, and I have no intention of stopping, no matter how long it takes!”</p>
                </div>
                <div class="anecdote-item" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 25px;">
                    <p>“My passion for mathematics was born in books. I started with a high-school level textbook to catch up, and in it, I discovered the beauty of rigorous proofs. Over the years, this curiosity has grown into an ever-expanding collection of scientific works, much like others collect vinyl records. I immerse myself daily in re-reading a few pages.”</p>

                    <p>“At 20, I had an ambitious dream: to get into the École Normale Supérieure by competing against the best students from the 'classes préparatoires'. For two years, I trained as one trains for a marathon. While I did not reach the final goal, I faced 6-hour exams with a difficulty comparable to the International Mathematical Olympiad. I still like to practice as if I were going to take the exam again tomorrow.”</p>
